# **BLOOMCART**  
### *Carting Your Way to Hope*  

## **Problem Statement**  
Domestic violence victims often struggle to find immediate help. Many face fear, trauma, and isolation, making it difficult to seek support. Some worry about being monitored, while others donâ€™t know where to turn. This lack of awareness and access to safe resources can leave survivors feeling trapped.  

## **Our Solution: BloomCart**  
BloomCart looks like a regular online shopping websiteâ€”but itâ€™s much more. Behind its discreet interface, it serves as a **lifeline for domestic violence survivors.**  

When a user "orders" a product, they are redirected to **BloomHelp**, a hidden support page designed to provide critical resources without drawing attention.  

### **Key Features of BloomHelp:**  
- **Discreet Access** â€“ A seamless transition from a shopping experience to a safe support space.  
- **Navigate Your Location** â€“ Helps users track their real-time location if they need assistance.  
- **Anonymous Messaging** â€“ Survivors can reach out without revealing their identity.  
- **Live Chat** â€“ Real-time support and guidance from trusted sources.  
- **Chatbot Assistance** â€“ Quick responses to common concerns and emergency guidance.  
- **Interactive Community Forums** â€“ A space to connect, share, and seek advice from others with similar experiences.  
- **Blog Posts** â€“ Stories of strength and survival, offering reassurance that no one is alone in this journey.  
- **Emergency Exit** â€“ A one-click escape that takes users back to the shopping page, ensuring safety if someone is watching.  

This project isn't just about technologyâ€”it's about providing **a safe, accessible, and discreet way for survivors to find help when they need it the most.**
